# Different types of positioning statements
- Least effective but most easy: A4B: "I do A for B"
  - Examples:
    - "I do content marketing and copywriting for purpose-driven brands. (I also often say: "I share messages that matter for conscious companies.")"
      - Tricky: "I share messages.." it's cool but it's not clear; clarity over cleverness!
      - Conjunction ("and"): decision not make yet what you do; pick highest value!
      - Don't have extra stuff in it
      - Better: "I do content-marketing for purpose-driven brands"
    - "I help brands and individuals refine and clarify their visual communication."
      - It is too broad: what kind of brand? what kind of individual?
      - This is not XYPS because it does not solve the business problem
      - Better: "I help small film studios to land better biddings for bigger clients"
    - "I make technology get out of the way, so that you're able to just focus on what you do best."
      - Bad: No target market
      
- XYPS - "I help X with Y"
  - not the same as A4B: *Y* is the business outcome and not the technical details
  - Examples:
    - "I help family-run food brands increase their D2C sales."
    - "I find solutions for problems that professional genealogist often face."
      - Better: Take *one* of the problems so that genealogists see that he is part of the tribe
    - "I help biotechnology companies eliminate friction between stakeholders and developers on web application projects."
      - Good: Biotech (target market)
      - Bad: Why does "between stakeholders and developers on web application projects" matter for Biotechs?
      - Better: "I help biotech companies to ensure their web app project won't get over budget"
    
- Most effective but most difficulty: LFPS (Laser-focussed Positioning Statement) - "I am a *discipline* who help *target market* with *expensive problem*. Unlike my competitors, I *unique difference*." 
  - Examples:
    - "Iâ€™m a Notion consultant, helping online entrepreneurs building their digital workspace by having their ideas, strategic plans, client projects and files in one place. Unlike my competitors I offer my services for the German speaking market."
    - "I'm a marketing strategist who helps small business owners who struggle with growth so that they can be (more) profitable."
