# Different types of positioning statements
- Least effective but most easy: A4B: "I do A for B"
  - Examples:
    - "I do content marketing and copywriting for purpose-driven brands. (I also often say: "I share messages that matter for conscious companies.")"
      - Tricky: "I share messages.." it's cool but it's not clear; clarity over cleverness!
      - Conjunction ("and"): decision not make yet what to do
    
- XYPS - "I help X with Y"
  - not the same as A4B: *Y* is the business outcome and not the technical details
  - Examples
    - "I help family-run food brands increase their D2C sales."
    - 
- Most effective but most difficulty: LFPS (Laser-focussed Positioning Statement) - "I am a *discipline* who help *target market* with *expensive problem*. Unlike my competitors, I *unique difference*."
